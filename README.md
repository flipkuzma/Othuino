Worked with two other partners to create a Arduino-controlled spinoff of a board game- Othello! The game included a LED matrix display, 
a controller with a joystick and button to handle player input, and a second controller for the LCD settings menu. 

The project ended up winning the award for Best in Show from the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago College of Engineering!
